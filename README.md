Writing Sample:
Undergraduate thesis: "Flood Forecasting in the Kushiyara River Using Supervised Machine Learning." Completed in 2022, this work demonstrates my approach to using machine learning models for flood forecasting in data-scarce regions.

Python Code Samples: 

Machine Learning: Contains the script from my BSc Thesis (2022), and Assignments from the Deep Learning course at UGA (2024)
Model Automation: Automation scripts (Python and bash) for the operational forecasting model that I worked on at RIMES in 2023.
Mapping: Contains scripts I wrote for a flood inundation and impact model at RIMES (2023) and a recent script for plotting my MS thesis model outputs.
